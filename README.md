# Wordscaper
I wrote a python script to help me play Wordscapes, the popular word puzzle mobile game for Android and iOS.

# Files
[words_alpha.txt] contains alpha words (only letters, no numbers or symbols). Taken from [https://github.com/dwyl/english-words]  
[wordscaper.py] is the primary script.
